<h1>Ancient Ruins Unscape Room and Theme Park</h1>

<i>On Adams Street, off US 12 in the Wisconsin Dells!</i>

<p>

You are <img src="assets/png/kristie.png"> <b>Kristie</b>, an employee at Ancient
Ruins Unscape Room and Theme Park.

<p>

Help <img src="assets/png/lara.png"> <b>Lara</b> and her many identical
relatives enjoy their vacation by reloading props, resetting traps, and
placing animatronic critters throughout the Unscape Room.

<p>

Lara must reach the <img src="assets/png/cup.png"> <b>Quite Valuable Cup</b>
at the end of the Unscape Room. You will lose points if she fails to 
reach the cup, gets too bored, or loses her suspension of disbelief.

<p>

You can press <img src="assets/png/placeholder-button.png"> <b>Buttons</b>
to open <img src="assets/png/placeholder-door.png"> <b>Doors</b> for Lara.
If Lara is blocked by a closed door for too long, she will get bored, and you
will lose points. But if she walks into a room that isn't properly reset
and gets confused, you will lose even more points.

<p>

<b>Staff Doors</b> <img src="assets/png/door-staff.png"> are disguised as
coffins. You'll lose points if Lara sees you use a Staff Door, but otherwise
she won't see them.

<p>

You can pick up <img src="assets/png/snake-1.png"> <b>Snakes</b> from the
supply closets and drop them in rooms. If Lara has a gun, she will shoot the
snake. If she is unarmed, she will flee. You will lose points if Lara thinks
the snake was too easy <b>or</b> too hard to defeat.
